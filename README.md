How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does 
creating “user stories” help with this?
 
On a personal level, my programming tends to be things that interest me, and 
so I would also be a user.  On a professional level, I have been working on the
system that I am working to be a software engineer on for over 20 years, with 
most of them working directly with our customer  and users.  All that to say, 
whether it is software engineering or systems engineering I always work with 
the end user in mind.  Writing "user stories" is primarily just putting my 
intentions in writing.
 
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to 
incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to software development has usually been all over the board.  That
was one thing I was hoping to overcome by getting my degree.  I have been
programming for over 20 years, but lacked the knowledge of organization to
a development project.  I have usually had some agile processes that I just
kind of did without knowing they are agile processes.  I have also been
working some projects at work that were done in agile without really knowing
what that meant.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I thought that it meant you had to be a top notch developer.  However I worked
on a development project at work and learned a valuable leason.  I didn't
have to be the best.  I had to be MY best.  I now think that being a good team
member means to do your best, support your team, and be there when needed.
